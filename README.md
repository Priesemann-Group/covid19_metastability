# Code repository for Long-term stable control of COVID-19 at low case numbers

In this repository you can find the supplementary code
for our publication [Contreras et al., 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg2243).

You can find the C++ code for our model implementation in the 'Cpp_Implementation' folder, the matlab Implementation in the 'MATLAB' folder and some scripts for plotting especially for the global overview figures in the 'Plotting' folder. For running the MATLAB codes make sure that both "Functions" and "Data_files" folders are in the path.

Additionally there is an interactive website to simulate different scenarios using our model (http://covid19-metastability.ds.mpg.de/) which is built upon the here presented C++ code.
